If you missed any of the components, you can modify the installation by running the Visual Studio Installer.

## 2. Set Environment Variables

Setting the environment variables is relatively harder on Windows than on Linux. 

To make your life easier, we provide a script to set the environment variables for you. You can find the script in the `scripts` folder.

**Before runing the script, make sure to check the content CAREFULLY and modify the paths to match your system.**

```bash
pwsh .\scripts\set-env-vars-windows.ps1
```
